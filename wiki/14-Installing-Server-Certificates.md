   - **Valid to**: ~10 years from creation

#### Test Browser Connection:
1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to: `https://localhost:3543` or `https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:3543`
3. **Expected result**: üîí Secure connection with no warnings
4. **Certificate details**: Should show valid certificate issued by WMSRootCA

### Android Verification

#### Check Certificate Installation:
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Security** ‚Üí **Encryption & credentials**
2. Tap **"Trusted credentials"**
3. Switch to the **"User"** tab
4. Look for your installed certificate (e.g., "WMS CA")

2. Configure the HTTPS endpoint: `https://YOUR-SERVER-IP:3543/api/barcodes.php`
3. Test the connection
4. **Expected result**: Successful connection without SSL errors

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Windows Issues

#### Certificate Not Showing in Browser
- **Solution**: Restart your browser after installing the certificate
- **Alternative**: Clear browser cache and reload the page

#### "Certificate not trusted" Error
- **Cause**: Certificate installed in wrong store
- **Solution**: Ensure certificate is in "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", not "Personal" or other stores

#### Permission Denied During Installation
- **Cause**: Insufficient privileges
- **Solution**: Run as administrator or install for "Current User" only

### Common Android Issues

#### Certificate Installation Fails
- **Cause**: Android version restrictions or file format issues
- **Solution**: Ensure the file has `.pem` extension and try renaming to `.crt`

#### App Still Shows SSL Errors
- **Cause**: App may be using certificate pinning or not respecting system certificates
- **Solution**: Check app-specific SSL settings or use HTTP endpoint temporarily

#### Certificate Not Found in Trusted Credentials
- **Cause**: Installation failed or certificate installed in wrong category
- **Solution**: Reinstall and ensure you select "CA certificate" during installation

### Network-Related Issues

#### Can't Access HTTPS URL
- **Cause**: HTTPS port (3543) not accessible
- **Solution**:
  - Check firewall settings
  - Verify Docker port mapping
  - Use HTTP (port 3500) temporarily

#### Certificate Warnings Despite Installation
- **Cause**: Accessing by different hostname/IP than certificate was issued for
- **Solution**:
  - Access using the exact hostname in the certificate
  - Regenerate certificates with correct hostname/IP
  - Add hostname to system hosts file

## üîÑ Certificate Renewal

### When to Renew
- **Server certificates**: Valid for 1 year, renew annually
- **CA certificates**: Valid for 10 years
- **Automatic renewal**: Run certificate generation scripts

### Renewal Process
1. Run `create-certificates.bat` (Windows) or `./create-certificates.sh` (Linux/Mac)
2. Update the web server with new certificates
3. Reinstall CA certificate on client devices if CA was renewed

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Important Security Notes
- **Self-signed certificates** are not inherently trusted by devices
- **Only install on devices you control** - don't distribute CA certificates widely
- **Monitor certificate expiration** and renew before expiry
- **Use proper certificates from trusted CAs** for production/public environments

### Best Practices
- **Regular renewal**: Set reminders for certificate renewal
- **Secure storage**: Keep private keys secure and backed up
- **Access control**: Limit who can generate and install certificates
- **Documentation**: Keep records of which devices have certificates installed

**Next Steps**: After installing certificates, configure your Android AI MultiBarcode Capture app to use the HTTPS endpoint for secure communication. See the [HTTP(s) Integration Guide](09-HTTP-Integration.md) for complete setup instructions.
