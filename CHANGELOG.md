### Technical Enhancements:
â€¢ Enhanced FileAdapter with OnSelectionChangeListener interface for real-time UI updates  
â€¢ Added long press detection using Handler with configurable timeout and movement cancellation  
â€¢ Implemented selection state callbacks to automatically update button and menu visibility  
â€¢ Modified visual selection logic to support both files and folders (excluding parent directory)  
â€¢ Fixed translation automation script double-escaping issues causing build failures  
â€¢ Maintained 100% translation coverage (197 strings Ã— 72 languages = 14,184 translations)  

The enhanced session management system provides intuitive folder operations while maintaining smart UI behavior that adapts to user selection context, ensuring optimal usability for both file and folder management tasks.

## Version 1.21
**Advanced AI Configuration System with Dynamic Settings Management**

Comprehensive AI and camera configuration capabilities with enterprise-grade managed configuration support:

â€¢ **Dynamic AI Configuration**: Advanced settings for AI model input size with three performance-optimized presets (640x640 Small, 1280x1280 Medium, 1600x1600 Large) including speed/accuracy guidance  
â€¢ **Camera Resolution Control**: Four resolution options (1MP, 2MP, 4MP, 8MP) with specific use case recommendations for different barcode types and distances  
â€¢ **Inference Processor Selection**: DSP (Digital Signal Processor), GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), and CPU (Central Processing Unit) options with performance characteristics  
â€¢ **Enterprise Managed Configuration**: Full EMM/MDM support with nested "advanced" settings bundle containing all three new configuration options  
â€¢ **Real-time Configuration Updates**: Settings changes automatically restart CameraXLivePreviewActivity and reload BarcodeTracker configuration without full app restart

## Version 1.18
**Persistent flashlight toggle with automatic state restoration**

Enhance camera functionality with persistent flashlight control that remembers user preferences across app sessions:

â€¢ Flashlight toggle icon automatically restores previous on/off state when opening camera view  
â€¢ Flashlight setting persists through app restarts, activity navigation, and device orientation changes    
â€¢ Improved user experience with consistent lighting preferences across barcode capture workflows  

Users can now toggle the flashlight on during scanning and expect it to remain active when returning to the camera view, providing continuous lighting support for challenging scanning environments without needing to manually re-enable the flashlight each time.

## Version 1.17
**Implement interactive capture zone with barcode filtering**

Add a complete capture zone system that allows users to define a rectangular area for focused barcode scanning:

â€¢ Interactive capture zone overlay with drag, resize, and corner anchor controls  
â€¢ Visual toggle icon in top-right corner with enabled/disabled states using alpha transparency  
â€¢ Real-time barcode filtering - only process barcodes within the capture zone boundaries  
â€¢ Persistent settings that save zone position, size, and enabled state across app sessions  
â€¢ Comprehensive capture data filtering - only capture barcodes within the defined zone  
â€¢ Force portrait mode across entire application for consistent user experience  
â€¢ Enhanced logging and error handling for capture zone operations  

The capture zone provides users with precise control over barcode detection, allowing them to focus on specific areas of the camera view while ignoring barcodes outside the defined region. When enabled, both the real-time preview and final capture results only include barcodes that intersect with the capture zone.
